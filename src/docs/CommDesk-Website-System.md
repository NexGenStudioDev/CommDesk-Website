# CommDesk Website Public Platform System

## Overview

This document defines the complete website-facing platform for CommDesk.

Implementation status note:

- this document is a target-state website specification
- current code in this repository is primarily desktop-focused and may not include these website routes yet
- check [CommDesk Implementation Status Matrix](./CommDesk-Implementation-Status.md) for current build reality

It covers public discovery, application, onboarding, participation, transparency, trust, and growth journeys.

This is the website side of CommDesk and should stay aligned with these system docs:

- [Community Signup System](https://github.com/NexGenStudioDev/CommDesk-Backend/blob/master/src/doc/Auth.doc.md)
- [CommDesk Member Creation and Onboarding System](https://github.com/NexGenStudioDev/CommDesk-Backend/blob/master/src/doc/Member.doc.md)
- [CommDesk Event System](./CommDesk-Event-System.md)
- [CommDesk RSVP System](./CommDesk-RSVP-System.md)
- [CommDesk Participant Platform System](./CommDesk-Participant-Platform-System.md)
- [CommDesk Judging System](./CommDesk-Judging-System.md)
- [CommDesk Sponsor and Partner System](./CommDesk-Sponsor-Partner-System.md)
- [CommDesk Frontend Boundary System (Desktop + Website)](./CommDesk-Frontend-Boundary-System.md)
- [CommDesk Community Trust, Review, and AI Scoring System](./CommDesk-Community-Trust-Scoring-System.md)
- [CommDesk Check-In and Badge System](./CommDesk-CheckIn-and-Badge-System.md)

Frontend ownership guardrail:

- Website is not allowed to duplicate desktop-owned operational write workflows.
- Desktop is not allowed to duplicate website-owned participant/public write workflows.
- Ownership details are defined in the Frontend Boundary System doc.

Primary website objectives:

- list all communities
- let users join communities
- let users discover and join events and hackathons
- support full participant journey after joining hackathon
- help users find and apply for jobs
- allow sponsor and partner self-registration
- provide transparent, trusted, and policy-safe public workflows

Core journey:
